<h1> Wetlab Design </h1>
  <h2>Concept</h2>
  <span class="text-dark" >A major constituent of the biofilm matrix is polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA), also known as polymeric N-acetyl-glucosamine (PNAG). The PIA polymer plays an important role in the structural integrity of biofilms in vitro and in vivo, however
      numerous studies have identified S. aureus strains capable of forming ica-independent biofilms where the matrix components of these biofilms were later identified as proteins and eDNA, which function as intercellular adhesins in the absence of
      PIA. Hence, using either eDNA and associated structural proteins that are present in the absence of PIA, and PIA as biomarkers for the composite lateral flow test will ensure that there is a greater likelihood that the test will have greater accuracy
      and sensitivity.
      </span>
<br />
<span class="text-dark" >The lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) is going to be
  used to indicate the presence of the biomarkers to dictate future action
  for treatment. A lateral flow immunoassay is a simple diagnostic device
  used to confirm the presence or absence of a target analyte, which is our
  chosen biomarkers. LFAs typically contain a control line to confirm the
  test is working properly, along with one or more target or test lines.
  They are designed to incorporate intuitive user protocols and require
  minimal training to operate. So how do sandwich LFAs work?
    </span>
    <ol>
      <li>The sample pad acts as the first stage of the absorption process, and in some cases contains a filter, to ensure the accurate and controlled flow of the sample into the rest of the test. </li>
      <li>The conjugate pad, which stores the conjugated labels and antibodies, will receive the sample. If the target is present, the immobilized conjugated antibodies and labels will bind to the target and continue to migrate along the test.</li>
      <li>As the sample moves along the device the binding reagents situated on the nitrocellulose membrane will bind to the target at the test line. A coloured line will form and the density of the line will vary depending on the quantity of the target
          present. Some targets may require quantification to determine target concentration. This is where a rapid test can be combined with a reader to provide quantitative results in order to ensure the levels detected in the reader are above that
          of a healthy human sample.</li>
