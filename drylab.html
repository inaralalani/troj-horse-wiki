      <h2 class="serif">What is it?</h2>

      <div>

          <h5 class="text-dark">Similar to a pregnancy test or rapid covid test, our team aims to deliver our PJI diagnosis solution through a disposable lateral flow immunoassay test, as described in Design and Workflow. Since we have multiple biomarkers, we would use a sandwich LFA, which works with a sample pad that absorbs the sample where the conjugate pad which stores the conjugated labels and antibodies, will receive the sample. If the target is present, the immobilized conjugated antibodies to gold nanoparticles and labels will bind to the target and continue to migrate along the test. If the sample moves across the test, it will be binded to its identical capture antibody, which would then appear as a coloured line on the test. Any excess antibodies will be used for the control. The sample will pass through the nitrocellulose membrane into the absorbent pad. The absorbent pad will absorb the excess sample.</h5>

            <br />
            <h5 class="text-dark">Plastic casing</h5>

            <span class="text-dark"
              >For easy use, the immunoassay strip and absorbent pads will be housed in a casing that exposes the area of the strip that will display results and the sample pad. Some rapid tests include clear casing over the immunoassay strip to prevent user error through the application of the sample directly to the strip, but this wonâ€™t be necessary as this test is designed to be used by individuals experienced in laboratory and testing techniques. If we want to create a proof of concept, we can skip this step for now and leave the assay exposed as a single test strip.

            <h5 class="text-dark">Dropper for sample</h5>

            <span class="text-dark"
              >Assuming that this test will be conducted in a laboratory environment, the sample will have been collected and prepared (as specified in Design and Workflow). The sample will need to be applied using a dropper to the exposed sample pad. We will need to determine the volume that the LFA can handle and should be used in order to have the most accurate results. This can be done through modeling and measuring the fluid dynamics of our sample on our chosen test strip. We would also need to determine if a buffer or a optimizing agent is required to ensure that the antibodies are not denatured by the sample, which would have to be a step that occurs before placing the sample on the test strip.

            <h5 class="text-dark">Immunoassay strip and conjugate pad</h5>

            <span class="text-dark"
              >Immunoassay strips are made of a nitrocellulose membrane, or non-woven fibers pressed into a strip. Since this is a composite test, there will be four regions coated with different substances. The first is the sample pad, this is a pad that is where we will drop the sample onto. There is the option to use an optimizer to magnify the concentration of the molecules within the analyte. The next line of the strip is the conjugate pad, which will contain our recombinantly made antibodies, which are our control, PNAG mAb, and IHF mAb, that are conjugated to a gold nanoparticle. Both antibodies will be here. The next two lines of the strip will be the capture pad. This is where there will be antibodies not conjugated to gold nanoparticles residing that will capture the migrating conjugated antibodies. The last line of the strip is the control line. It will contain either an anti-IgG antibody, or a polyclonal antibody that will capture the control IgG antibody. The wicking pad absorbs any excess sample.

            <span class="text-dark"
              >The sample used in the test will be applied to the sample pad. The sample will then travel through the conjugate strip. If the target is present, it will continue to move across the immunoassay strip via capillary action, terminating at the absorption/wick pad at the other end

          <h2 class="serif">How this would be executed:</h2>
          <span class="text-dark"
            >Immunoassay strips and absorbent pads would need to be sourced from pharmaceutical supply companies as they require specialized manufacturing. Coating the conjugate pad and immunoassay strip can be performed by wet lab members. This can be accomplished using the protocols outlined in Workflow. Personnel performing these tasks would need to be skilled in performing these protocols.If commercialized, a plastic casing would be appropriate. This can be designed by drylab members, but would likely require an external manufacturer for mass production. For proof of concept, a casing could be designed by a team member skilled in CAD models, and then 3D printed. For test proof of concept, a casing is not required. The pads can be placed in the appropriate positions on top of the immunoassay strip to perform the test.
